            <h2>Project 1 Report</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The website, while being based on a hobby of mine, is designed for an audience other than myself, that audience being less experienced players.</li>
                <li>The textual content was written by me from memory. I did use third-party images, crediting whenever possible.</li>
                <li>The site contains five pages, excluding this report.</li>
                <li>The site includes a header.</li>
                <li>The site has a navbar.</li>
                <li>I utilized media queries to make the navbar vertical rather than horizontal on smaller screens, and also divide the non-index pages into three columns on large screens.</li>
                <li>Styles are included in a shared stylesheet (styles.css), and the gallery CSS is in a separate stylesheet to keep things organized.</li>
                <li>Images are included in the form of the Logo on the top of each page, as well as a slideshow gallery for some of the individual pages.</li>
                <li>The favicon is declared, however refuses to show up on Chrome for some reason, but works on Edge.</li>
                <li>The stylesheets and script are organized into the css and js folders respectively.</li>
                <li>I did not use Bootstrap or similar frameworks.</li>
                <li>The pages passed the Nu Validator.</li>
                <li>The content is generally left-aligned, however the header is center-aligned to distinguish it.</li>
                <li>I have included padding in most cases.</li>
                <li>I used the Fonts Orbitron (for headings) and Raleway (for text), which I found on Google fonts.</li>
                <li>On the index page, I have included a contact form.</li>
                <li>On gtnh.html and impact.html, I have included links to the official websites for those modpacks.</li>
                <li>All of my class names use kebab-case and have meaningful names.</li>
                <li>I made a slideshow gallery using CSS and JavaScript to use on the info pages.</li>
                <li>I have shared the site in a repository accessible <a href="https://github.com/mcadventurecity/cs347-project1">here</a>.</li>
                <li>My file names are all lowercase.</li>
                <li>I have set up the Apache configuration to redirect http to https.</li>
                <li>I followed the tutorial "Forcing HTTPS" on twodee.org to do this.</li>
                <li>Apache has been configured to redirect.</li>
                <li>While it did seem like the commits were condensed, that was because I got a late start.</li>
