            <h2>What is GregTech?</h2>
            <p>GregTech is a series of modifications, or mods for the sandbox video game Minecraft, originally created by German software developer GregoriusT. The GregTech series of mods originated around 2012 as an addon for the popular mod IndustrialCraft 2, but later became much more than that.</p>
            <p>GregTech, in the modern sense, focuses on adding many forms of realistic technology and industry to Minecraft, including various machines, resources, and processing methods. The current major GregTech versions are GregTech 5 Unofficial, for Minecraft 1.7.10, GregTech 6 for that same version, and GregTech Community Edition for Minecraft 1.12.2. For each of these versions, there exist a few popular Modpacks, collections of Mods by various developers that are configured and curated to a certain playstyle. In the case of Modpacks featuring GregTech, that style involves configuring other mods to make their blocks and items require the use of GregTech materials or processing. The process of configuring mods in a GregTech modpack is often called "Gregifying" those mods by the community.</p>
            <p>This website provides an overview of some of the most popular modpacks featuring GregTech, and their difficulty levels and features, to help prospective GregTech players decide what they want to play!</p>
