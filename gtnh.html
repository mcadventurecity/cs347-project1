                <h3>Pack Description</h3>
                <p>GregTech New Horizons is one of the most difficult GregTech Modpacks. Featuring not only GregTech 5 Unofficial, but also several custom mods adding even more content, this modpack will keep you occupied for a LONG time. GregTech New Horizons changes most in-game crafting recipes, even those of items in Vanilla Minecraft. Want to make a door? You'll need wood, but also iron screws and rings, which require tools such as a Hammer, File, and Saw. While this may seem annoying at first, as you progress into the electrical ages of GregTech, earlier items gradually become easier.</p>
                <p>GregTech New Horizons also features mods such as Applied Energistics 2 and Steve's Factory Manager, to assist in fully automating your ever-growing factory.</p>
                <p>Want to become a master mage? GregTech New Horizons also features magical themed mods such as Thaumcraft, Witchery, and Blood Magic. However, magical progression will build off the various tiers of technology, as well as exploration through the mysterious Twilight Forest dimension.</p>
                <p>What is the goal of all this? Well, after much upgrading of your factory's infrastructure, and the (hopefully automatic) collection of millions of raw materials, you can craft the famed Stargate, an item once thought to be impossible to obtain. However, Russian player Houstonruss proved in Spring 2021 that it is, indeed, possible, by crafting the first two Stargates of any GregTech New Horizons player, and thus completing the objective, all via his factory, known as the "Big-Flex Gigaplex".</p>
